# Analyzing Olympic Data with Tableau

## Project Overview

This project involves analyzing Olympic data from Kaggle datasets using *SQL Server* for data extraction and *Tableau* for data visualization. The main objective was to create an interactive dashboard to showcase Olympic performance across different countries, focusing on key metrics such as *Medals Won, **Athlete Participation, and **Country-Wise Analysis*.

### Key Features

- *Data Source*: Olympic datasets from Kaggle were used for analysis.
- *Data Processing*: SQL Server was used to implement queries to fetch and preprocess the data for analysis.
- *Visualization: Developed an interactive dashboard in **Tableau* to visualize:
  - Country-wise medal tally.
  - Athlete participation across years.
  - Performance comparison among countries.
- *Publishing: The Tableau dashboard was published using **Tableau Public* for easy accessibility and sharing.
